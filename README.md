# ScDownloader

Small tool for Using SickChill to obtain files that a generally difficult to find.

Needs fairly strict naming, but bridges the gap between a show in TheTVBD/Sickchill and something with different release names.

# Instructions

Update the config.ini (copy from master) with your sickchill host, api, sabnzbd host and api and newznzb host (tested with nzbgeek).

The show name/show id you obtain from sickchill.

Run with: 
```python scdownloader.py```
when the config.ini is in with the program files.
